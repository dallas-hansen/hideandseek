The idea behind this is from this [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNBHwp1DbgA&t=1089s) video.

# How to play
Each player begins on a random space, but they can't see the map.
One person is selected to be the first 'seeker'.
Determine turn order, seeker always starts.
The seekers goal is to tag another player.
Once a player has been tagged they are now the seeker and teleported to a random space.

One round is completed once each person gets a turn.
After each round, successful hiders get +1 hiding point.
First person to get to 25 hiding points wins.

Spaces can either be good, bad, neutral, shop, and teleport.
A space is activated by any means in which you land on it.
